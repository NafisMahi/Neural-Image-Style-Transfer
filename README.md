# Neural-Image-Style-Transfer

This project is inspired by the seminal paper from Gatys et al., on neural style transfer. The goal of this project is to explore and implement the neural style transfer technique where the style of one image is combined with the content of another using convolutional neural networks.

## Repository Structure

- `1805027_1805028.pdf`: Contains the slides presenting an overview and results of the project.
- `NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for implementing the neural style transfer.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to set up and run the code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch (as per your preference)
- Matplotlib (for image visualization)
- PIL or OpenCV (for image processing)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:
```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-directory
pip install -r requirements.txt

###Running

To run the notebook:
jupyter notebook NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb
